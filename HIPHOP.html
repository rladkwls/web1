    <h2>HIPHOP</h2>
    <p>Hip hop or hip-hop is a culture and art movement that was created by African Americans,
        Latino Americans and Caribbean Americans in the Bronx, New York City. The origin of the name is often disputed.
        It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx.
        While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (including rap),
        hip hop is characterized by four key elements: "rapping" (also called MCing or emceeing),
        a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism),
        which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti.
        Other elements are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style;
        street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others.
        The fifth element, although debated, is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion, or beatboxing.</p>

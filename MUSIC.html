    <h2>MUSIC</h2>
    <p><strong>Music</strong> is <u>the art of arranging sounds</u> in time to produce a composition through
the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
It is one of the cultural universal aspects of all human societies.
General definitions of music include common elements such as <a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%BC%EC%B9%98" target="_blank" title="pitch">pitch (which governs melody and harmony)</a>,
rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness),
and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).</p>
